It didn't take long though to find UCF's prestigious animation program was nothing like the 3D modeling class that I had enjoyed as it required a lot of fundamental classes with physical mediums that I quite struggled with. It wasn't until at least halfway through my third year of college I had started to find what I really enjoyed, and that was taking Game Design classes under the Digital Media program and programming classes under the Computer Science program. I managed to combine a lot of the other credits I had taken and end up graduating in 2020 at the beginning of COVID with an Inderdisciplinary Studies degree with a focus in Art and Communication and minors in Digital Media and Computer Science. I graduated Cum Laude, with the only grades that ever dragged me down were the dreaded French classes. Part of what helped me grow and solidify my passions in game design and programming was when I went to my first game jam. In 2019, I participated in the Intergalactic Space Jam in Orlando. I joined a random team of people and worked under another developer using the Unreal Engine. I had never used Unreal or C++, so it was a long 3 days, but I had pushed through and learned a lot.
